    <h2>HTML Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML
      consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap,
      different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a
      certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to
      somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller,
      and so on.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the
        element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing
        <strong>angle brackets</strong>. This states where the element begins or
        starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag,
        except that it includes a <em>forward slash</em> before the element
        name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the
        paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard
        beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which
        in this case, is just text.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the
        content together comprise the element.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Elements have attributes</h3>
    <p><img src="/lesson-text/attribute.png" alt="attribute-mdn" /></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if
        the element already has one or more attributes).
      </li>
      <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
      <li>
        The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
      </li>
      <h2>Basic Elements</h2>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> —
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype">doctype</a>. It is a required
        preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92),
        doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page
        had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic
        error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't
        do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves
        correctly. That's all you need to know for now.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code> — the
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html"
          ><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></a
        >
        element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is
        sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the
        <code>lang</code> attribute, setting the primary language of the
        document.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> — the
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head"
          ><code>&lt;head&gt;</code></a
        >
        element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to
        include on the HTML page that <em>isn't</em> the content you are showing
        to your page's viewers. This includes things like
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Keyword">keywords</a> and a page
        description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our
        content, character set declarations, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code> — This element sets the
        character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most
        characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it
        can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no
        reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</code> —
        This
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Viewport_concepts#mobile_viewports"
          >viewport element</a
        >
        ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile
        browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking
        them down.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code> — the
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title"
          ><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></a
        >
        element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that
        appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to
        describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> — the
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body"
          ><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a
        >
        element. This contains <em>all</em> the content that you want to show to
        web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images,
        videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
