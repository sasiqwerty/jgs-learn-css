    <h2>HTML Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML
      consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap,
      different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a
      certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to
      somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller,
      and so on.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the
        element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing
        <strong>angle brackets</strong>. This states where the element begins or
        starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag,
        except that it includes a <em>forward slash</em> before the element
        name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the
        paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard
        beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which
        in this case, is just text.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the
        content together comprise the element.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Elements have attributes</h3>
    <p><img src="/lesson-text/attribute.png" alt="attribute-mdn" /></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if
        the element already has one or more attributes).
      </li>
      <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
      <li>
        The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
      </li>
    </ol>
